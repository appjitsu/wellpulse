---

## 2. Security Layer (`src/security/`)

### 2.1 Encryption Service (`security/encryption.rs`)

**Implementation**:
- AES-256-GCM decryption for passwords stored in database
- Base64-encoded key management from environment variable
- Nonce + ciphertext format: `base64(nonce[12 bytes] + ciphertext)`
- Safe key validation (must be 32 bytes / 256 bits)

**Security Features**:
- No plaintext passwords in memory after decryption
- Secure key loading from `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable
- Comprehensive unit tests with test key generation

---

### 2.2 Authentication Validator (`security/authenticator.rs`)

**Implementation**:
- Credential validation (username, password)
- Encrypted password decryption
- IP whitelisting support
- Certificate validation (TLS/OPC-UA)

**Validation Rules**:
- Non-empty username/password
- Automatic decryption of encrypted passwords
- Source IP validation against whitelist
- Security mode validation for protocols

---

### 2.3 Data Validator (`security/data_validator.rs`)

**Implementation**:
- **Range checks** for Oil & Gas tags (oil_rate, gas_rate, tubing_pressure, etc.)
- **Quality flag validation** (reject Bad/Uncertain readings)
- **Statistical anomaly detection** (z-score > 3 std dev)
- Configurable thresholds and validation rules

**Default Validation Rules** (Oil & Gas specific):
```rust
oil_rate:          0 - 10,000 bbl/day
gas_rate:          0 - 50,000 MCF/day
water_rate:        0 - 20,000 bbl/day
tubing_pressure:   0 - 5,000 PSI
casing_pressure:   0 - 5,000 PSI
temperature:      -40 - 300°F
flow_rate:         0 - 500 bbl/min
```

**Statistical Tracking**:
- Moving average and standard deviation per tag
- Minimum sample size (default 100) before anomaly detection
- Configurable z-score threshold (default 3.0)

---

## 3. Health Monitoring System (`src/health/mod.rs`)

### 3.1 Connection Health Tracking

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Connection status (Connected, Disconnected, Reconnecting, CircuitOpen)
- Last successful reading timestamp
- Consecutive failures count
- Total failures/successes count
- Uptime percentage
- Circuit breaker state (Closed, Open, HalfOpen)

---

### 3.2 Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Implementation**:
- **Closed**: Normal operation, connection is healthy
- **Open**: Too many failures (default 5), stop attempting connections
- **HalfOpen**: After timeout (default 5 minutes), test if connection recovered

**Configuration**:
```rust
circuit_breaker_threshold: 5      // Open after 5 consecutive failures
circuit_breaker_timeout_secs: 300 // Wait 5 minutes before half-open
```

---

### 3.3 Automatic Reconnection with Exponential Backoff

**Strategy**:
- Initial backoff: 1 second
- Maximum backoff: 60 seconds
- Backoff multiplier: 2.0 (exponential)
- Maximum retry attempts: 10 (configurable, 0 = infinite)

**Backoff Sequence**:
```
Attempt 1: 1s delay
Attempt 2: 2s delay
Attempt 3: 4s delay
Attempt 4: 8s delay
Attempt 5: 16s delay
Attempt 6: 32s delay
Attempt 7: 60s delay (max)
Attempt 8: 60s delay
...
```

---

## 4. Enhanced Error Handling

### 4.1 Error Categorization

**Categories**:
- **Network**: Connection failures, disconnections
- **Auth**: Authentication failures
- **Config**: Invalid configuration, invalid addresses
- **Protocol**: Protocol-specific errors, read/write failures
- **Timeout**: Response timeouts
- **Io**: Low-level I/O errors

### 4.2 Retry Classification

**Retryable Errors** (transient, will retry):
- ConnectionFailed
- NotConnected
- Timeout
- IoError
- ReadFailed

**Fatal Errors** (permanent, will not retry):
- AuthenticationFailed
- InvalidConfiguration
- UnsupportedProtocol
- InvalidAddress

## 9. Deployment Considerations

### 9.1 Production Checklist

**Before deployment**:
- [ ] Generate strong 32-byte encryption key: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- [ ] Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Configure IP whitelist for production SCADA networks
- [ ] Enable TLS certificate validation (`VALIDATE_CERTIFICATES=true`)
- [ ] Review and adjust validation thresholds for specific wells
- [ ] Configure circuit breaker thresholds based on network reliability
- [ ] Set up monitoring for health metrics (Prometheus endpoint)

### 9.2 Network Requirements

**Firewall Rules** (outbound from SCADA ingestion service):
- OPC-UA: TCP 4840
- Modbus TCP: TCP 502
- MQTT: TCP 1883 (or 8883 for TLS)
- DNP3: TCP 20000 (configurable)
- HART-IP: UDP 5094

### 9.3 Resource Requirements

**Recommended**:
- CPU: 4+ cores (for parallel protocol polling)
- RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for 100+ connections)
- Network: Low latency (<50ms) to SCADA devices
- Database: Connection pooling (10+ connections for multi-tenant)

## 10. Next Steps for Full Production

### 10.1 Protocol Implementation Completion

**Current Status**: All protocols are **structurally complete** with stubbed implementations

**To Complete**:
1. **Test Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Set up OPC-UA test server (Prosys OPC UA Simulation Server)
   - Set up Modbus TCP simulator (pyModbusTCP)
   - Set up DNP3 outstation simulator
   - Set up HART-IP simulator
   - Set up EtherNet/IP PLC simulator (or real hardware)

2. **Remove Stubs**:
   - Uncomment production code in each adapter
   - Test against real/simulated devices
   - Validate data quality and performance

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Multi-protocol simultaneous connections
   - Failover and reconnection testing
   - Circuit breaker behavior validation
   - Load testing (100+ concurrent connections)

### 10.2 Security Enhancements

**Immediate**:
- [ ] Implement TLS certificate validation for OPC-UA
- [ ] Add rate limiting per connection
- [ ] Implement audit logging for authentication failures
- [ ] Add support for client certificates (mutual TLS)

**Future**:
- [ ] HSM integration for encryption key storage
- [ ] OAuth2/JWT for API authentication
- [ ] Network segmentation recommendations
- [ ] SIEM integration for security events

### 10.3 Monitoring & Observability

**Metrics to Add**:
- Connection uptime per protocol/tenant
- Read success rate per tag
- Circuit breaker state changes
- Anomaly detection trigger rate
- Protocol-specific error rates

**Dashboards**:
- Grafana dashboard for real-time connection health
- Alert rules for circuit breaker open events
- Performance metrics (reads/sec, latency percentiles)

## 11. Important Trade-Offs & Decisions

### 11.1 Stub Implementations

**Decision**: Implement full protocol structure with stubbed network I/O

**Rationale**:
- Real SCADA devices not available in development
- Structure is production-ready and testable
- Easy to "un-stub" with test infrastructure

**Impact**: Service compiles and starts, but requires test devices for full operation

### 11.2 Encryption Service

**Decision**: AES-256-GCM with optional encryption

**Rationale**:
- Backward compatibility (can disable for legacy systems)
- Strong encryption standard
- Simple key management via environment variable

**Impact**: Must secure `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in production (use secrets manager)

### 11.3 Circuit Breaker Defaults

**Decision**: 5 failures threshold, 5-minute timeout

**Rationale**:
- Balance between responsiveness and stability
- Prevents thundering herd on network recovery
- Allows time for transient network issues to resolve

**Impact**: May need tuning based on specific network conditions
