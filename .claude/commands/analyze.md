Analyze the codebase for patterns, issues, or understanding:

1. **Define Analysis Scope:**
   - What are we analyzing? (performance, security, architecture, specific feature)
   - What's the goal? (find bugs, understand flow, identify improvements, learn patterns)

2. **Gather Data:**
   - Read relevant files based on scope
   - Check patterns used: `ls docs/patterns/`
   - Review architecture layers
   - Look at test coverage if relevant
   - Check git history for context if needed

3. **Analysis Focus Areas:**
   - **Architecture**: Layer separation, dependencies, pattern usage
   - **Code Quality**: Complexity, duplication, naming, type safety
   - **Performance**: N+1 queries, inefficient algorithms, missing indexes
   - **Security**: RBAC enforcement, input validation, SQL injection risks
   - **Testing**: Coverage, test quality, missing test cases
   - **Patterns**: Pattern application, anti-patterns, pattern opportunities

4. **Generate Report:**
   - **Findings**: What was discovered
   - **Metrics**: Quantitative data (coverage, complexity, size)
   - **Strengths**: What's done well
   - **Issues**: Problems found with severity ratings
   - **Recommendations**: Specific, actionable improvements
   - **Examples**: Code snippets demonstrating findings

5. **Visualize if Helpful:**
   - Architecture diagrams (ASCII art)
   - Flow charts for complex logic
   - Dependency graphs
   - Data models

Provide educational insights to help improve understanding of the codebase.
