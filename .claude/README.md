## 🎯 Best Practices

### DO:

✅ Use slash commands for structured workflows
✅ Let Claude run quality checks automatically
✅ Provide context about what you're trying to achieve
✅ Review generated code before committing
✅ Use `/review` before creating PRs
✅ Use `/analyze` when learning unfamiliar code

### DON'T:

❌ Skip quality checks to save time (they catch issues early)
❌ Use `/quick-fix` for complex changes (use `/feature` or `/refactor`)
❌ Commit without running tests
❌ Ignore pattern documentation (`docs/patterns/`)
❌ Hard delete data (use soft delete with `deletedAt`)

## 🏗️ Architecture Reminders

### Backend (Hexagonal Architecture)

```
Presentation (Controllers, DTOs)
    ↓
Application (Commands, Queries, Handlers)
    ↓
Domain (Entities, Value Objects, Events)
    ↑
Infrastructure (Repositories, DB, External APIs)
```

**Layer Order for Features:**

1. Domain entities & events
2. Repository interfaces
3. Command/Query handlers
4. Repository implementations
5. Controllers & DTOs
6. Tests (80%+ coverage)

### Frontend (Layered Architecture)

```
UI (Pages, Components)
    ↓
State (React Query, Zustand)
    ↓
Business Logic (Commands, Queries)
    ↓
Data Access (Repositories, API Client)
```

**Implementation Order:**

1. TypeScript types
2. API repositories
3. React Query hooks
4. UI components
5. Pages
6. Tests

## 🤝 Working with Claude Code

### Effective Communication

**Good:**

> "I need to add a budget alert feature that notifies managers when projects exceed 80% of budget. It should check hourly and send emails."

**Better:**

> "/feature
> Add budget alert system:
>
> - Monitor project budgets in real-time
> - Alert at 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% thresholds
> - Email notifications to project managers
> - Backend: scheduled task + email service
> - Frontend: alerts page with acknowledgment"

### Multi-Step Tasks

For complex tasks, Claude Code works best with clear phases:

```
User: /feature Implement invoice PDF generation
Claude: [Plans the feature with checklist]
User: Let's start with the backend
Claude: [Implements domain → application → infrastructure → presentation]
User: /test Write tests for the PDF service
Claude: [Writes comprehensive tests]
User: /quality
Claude: [Runs all checks and reports status]
```

## 🚀 Advanced Skills Guide

### Database Migration Intelligence (`/migrate`)

Generates optimized migrations with automatic dependency analysis.

**What it does:**

- Analyzes existing schemas and detects dependencies
- Suggests optimal indexes (foreign keys, composite indexes)
- Validates foreign key cascade strategies
- Checks for circular dependencies
- Estimates migration time
- Provides up and down migrations

**Example:**

```
/migrate "add estimates table with line items and client approval"
```

**Output:**

- Dependency analysis (organizations, clients, users tables)
- Similar pattern detection (85% match with invoices)
- Recommended schema with optimized indexes
- Migration SQL generation
- Step-by-step implementation guide

---

### Architectural Consistency Guardian (`/arch-check`)

Validates hexagonal architecture compliance and detects layer violations.

**What it checks:**

- Layer boundary violations (Controller → Repository)
- CQRS separation (Commands modify, Queries read)
- Dependency direction (all point inward to Domain)
- Pattern compliance (Repository, DTO, Value Objects)

**Example:**

```
/arch-check estimate.controller.ts
```

**Detects:**

- ❌ Controllers directly importing Repositories (should use CQRS)
- ❌ Domain importing Infrastructure (breaks architecture)
- ❌ Business logic in Presentation layer (should be in Domain)

**Provides:**

- Specific line numbers and import violations
- Refactoring suggestions with code examples
- Pattern references for correct implementation

---

### Test Coverage Strategy Planner (`/test-strategy`)

Generates comprehensive test plans with effort estimates.

**What it analyzes:**

- Code complexity (cyclomatic complexity, public methods)
- Business rules and edge cases
- Integration points (database, external APIs)
- Current vs target coverage

**Example:**

```
/test-strategy estimate.entity.ts
```

**Generates:**

- Unit test plan (12 tests, ~30 minutes)
- State transition tests (8 tests, ~20 minutes)
- Edge case tests (10 tests, ~25 minutes)
- Integration tests (6 tests, ~30 minutes)
- Test templates with AAA pattern
- Coverage estimate (85-90%)

**Output includes:**

- Specific test cases to write
- Time estimates per test type
- Implementation order (happy path first)
- Reference to similar existing tests

---

### Performance Profiler & Optimizer (`/perf-audit`)

Detects performance issues and suggests optimizations with impact estimates.

**What it finds:**

- 🔥 N+1 query problems
- ⚠️ Missing database indexes
- 💡 Caching opportunities
- 📊 Inefficient algorithms
- 🧠 Memory issues (large result sets, no pagination)

**Example:**

```
/perf-audit get-estimates.handler.ts
```

**Real impact example:**

```
N+1 Query Problem:
  Current: 201 queries for 100 estimates (2000ms)
  After fix: 1 query (50ms)
  Impact: 40x faster! 🚀
```

**Provides:**

- Specific code locations (line numbers)
- Performance metrics (before/after)
- Multiple solution options (JOIN, DataLoader, eager loading)
- Index recommendations with SQL
- Caching strategies with Redis examples

---

### API Contract Validator (`/api-validate`)

Validates API contracts between frontend and backend to prevent breaking changes.

**What it checks:**

- DTO ↔ Frontend type compatibility
- Date serialization (Date vs string)
- Breaking changes (removed/renamed fields)
- Response shape consistency
- Enum value matching

**Example:**

```
/api-validate estimate.controller.ts
```

**Detects:**

- 🚨 Field removed from DTO that frontend still uses
- ⚠️ Type mismatch (Date object vs ISO string)
- 💡 Missing frontend types for new endpoints

**Provides:**

- Side-by-side comparison (backend DTO vs frontend type)
- Migration paths for breaking changes
- ApiResponse type pattern for date serialization
- Impact analysis (how many files affected)

---

### Security Audit Assistant (`/sec-audit`)

Automated security scanning for common vulnerabilities.

**What it checks:**

- 🔒 RBAC (missing @RequirePermissions guards)
- 🛡️ Input validation (missing class-validator decorators)
- 🔐 PII exposure (email/phone in logs)
- ⚡ Authentication gaps (missing guards)
- 💾 Data exposure (soft delete not checked)

**Example:**

```
/sec-audit estimate.controller.ts
```

**OWASP Top 10 Coverage:**

- A01: Broken Access Control
- A03: Injection (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- A07: Identification and Authentication Failures

**Provides:**

- Severity ratings (CRITICAL, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Specific vulnerabilities with line numbers
- Fix suggestions with code examples
- RBAC permission checklist
- Compliance checks (GDPR, SOC 2)

---

### Dependency Graph Navigator (`/deps`)

Visualize and analyze file dependencies across the monorepo.

**What it shows:**

- Files that import the target ("used by")
- Files that the target imports ("depends on")
- Impact analysis (how many files affected)
- Circular dependency detection
- Cross-monorepo usage (backend → frontend)

**Example:**

```
/deps estimate.entity.ts
```

**Output:**

```
USED BY: 12 files
  Application: 6 handlers
  Infrastructure: 2 services
  Presentation: 3 controllers
  Frontend: 11 components

IMPACT: Changing this entity affects 34 files (transitive)
EFFORT: 4-6 hours for refactoring
```

**Use cases:**

- Before refactoring (understand blast radius)
- Detect dead code (0 dependencies)
- Find circular dependencies
- Estimate refactoring effort

---

### Domain Event Choreography Designer (`/events`)

Map domain events to handlers and visualize event-driven workflows.

**What it maps:**

- Event publishers (which entities/methods)
- Event subscribers (handlers that listen)
- Event flow (trigger → handlers → cascading events)
- Orphaned events (published but no handlers)

**Example:**

```
/events estimate.entity.ts
```

**Visualizes:**

```
EstimateAcceptedEvent
  ├→ SendAcceptanceConfirmationHandler (500ms)
  ├→ CreateProjectFromEstimateHandler (300ms)
  │   └→ ProjectCreatedEvent (cascading!)
  ├→ UpdateOrganizationHealthHandler (50ms)
  └→ NotifySalesTeamHandler (200ms)

Total: 1050ms + cascading handlers
```

**Detects:**

- 🔴 Events with no subscribers (forgotten handlers)
- ⚠️ Cascading events (event triggers event)
- 💡 Performance bottlenecks (slow handlers)

---

### Code-to-Documentation Sync (`/doc-sync`)

Keep documentation in sync with code changes.

**What it detects:**

- New methods not documented
- Changed signatures in outdated docs
- Pattern examples that reference old code
- Missing README entries

**Example:**

```
/doc-sync estimate.entity.ts
```

**Generates:**

- Method documentation (JSDoc format)
- Sequence diagrams (Mermaid)
- Pattern doc updates
- README sections for domain modules
- OpenAPI decorators

**Auto-updates:**

- `docs/patterns/` (adds examples from your code)
- `apps/api/src/domain/{entity}/README.md` (method docs)
- `docs/sprints/` (implementation status)
- API documentation (OpenAPI specs)

---

### Cross-Sprint Learning Agent (`/learn`)

Learn from past sprints to improve estimates and avoid repeated mistakes.

**What it analyzes:**

- Sprint patterns (implementation approaches)
- Gotchas (repeated mistakes)
- Velocity trends (estimated vs actual)
- Time-saving opportunities

**Example:**

```
/learn sprint-5 sprint-6 sprint-7
```

**Provides:**

```
Pattern: New Entity Implementation (6 occurrences)
  Average: 98 hours
  Savings: 30-40 hours using invoice.entity.ts template

Gotcha: Forgot RBAC permissions (3x)
  Cost: 2-4 hours to fix each time
  Solution: Use checklist (now automated)

Velocity: 81% → 103% accuracy (improving!)
```

**Recommendations:**

- Adjusted time estimates for current sprint
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Efficiency boosters (proven patterns)
- Optimized execution order

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Command not found?**

- Check spelling (case-sensitive)
- Ensure `.md` file exists in `commands/`
- Try `/help` to see available commands

**Quality checks failing?**

- Run individually: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, etc.
- Check error messages carefully
- Use `/debug` for help resolving issues

**Tests not passing?**

- Check test output for specific failures
- Ensure test database is set up correctly
- Verify environment variables in `.env.test`

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Use Tab Completion**: Type `/` and tab to see commands
2. **Chain Commands**: Run `/feature` then `/test` then `/quality` then `/pr`
3. **Ask for Explanations**: "Explain how the CQRS pattern works here"
4. **Request Patterns**: "Show me examples of the Repository pattern in this codebase"
5. **Get Context**: `/analyze the time entry feature`
6. **Learn by Doing**: Ask Claude to implement something then explain each part
