    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    well_id UUID NOT NULL,
    trend_date TIMESTAMP,
    direction VARCHAR(10), -- 'up', 'flat', 'down'
    slope DECIMAL,
    r_squared DECIMAL,
    forecast_json JSONB,
    calculated_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(tenant_id, well_id, trend_date)
  );
  ```

- [ ] Add indexes for performance
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_aggregates_lookup ON time_series_aggregates(tenant_id, well_id, aggregation_period, period_start);
  CREATE INDEX idx_trends_lookup ON production_trends(tenant_id, well_id, trend_date);
  ```

- [ ] Create dashboard KPIs view
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW dashboard_kpis AS
  SELECT
    t.id as tenant_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN f.production_data->>'oilVolume' IS NOT NULL
        THEN (f.production_data->>'oilVolume')::decimal ELSE 0 END) as total_oil_24h,
    SUM(CASE WHEN f.production_data->>'gasVolume' IS NOT NULL
        THEN (f.production_data->>'gasVolume')::decimal ELSE 0 END) as total_gas_24h,
    COUNT(DISTINCT w.id) FILTER (WHERE w.status = 'ACTIVE') as active_wells_count
  FROM tenants t
  LEFT JOIN wells w ON w.tenant_id = t.id AND w.deleted_at IS NULL
  LEFT JOIN field_entries f ON f.well_id = w.id
    AND f.entry_type = 'PRODUCTION'
    AND f.recorded_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
    AND f.deleted_at IS NULL
  GROUP BY t.id;
  ```

**Performance:**
