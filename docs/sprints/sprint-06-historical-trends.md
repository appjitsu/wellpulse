## User Stories

### US-1001: Aggregate Production Data into Time Series

**As a** data aggregation service
**I want** to calculate daily/weekly/monthly production summaries
**So that** trends can be visualized without querying millions of raw field entries

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Daily aggregates created at 23:59 CT for each well
- [ ] Weekly aggregates created every Monday at 00:00 CT
- [ ] Monthly aggregates created on 1st of month at 00:00 CT
- [ ] Aggregates calculate: sum, avg, min, max, stddev for each numeric field
- [ ] Aggregates handle wells with multiple entries per day (average them)
- [ ] Backfill job can calculate aggregates for historical data
- [ ] No duplicate aggregates if job runs multiple times

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Domain Layer:**
  - `TimeSeriesAggregate` entity with factory methods: `createDaily()`, `createWeekly()`, `createMonthly()`
  - Value objects: `AggregationWindow`, `TimeSeriesMetrics`
  - Business logic: `isComplete()` (has minimum entries), `canMerge(other)`

- **Application Layer:**
  - `AggregateProductionDataCommand` - Triggered by scheduler
  - `GetTimeSeriesQuery` - Retrieve aggregates for visualization
  - `BackfillAggregatesCommand` - Populate historical data

- **Infrastructure Layer:**
  - `TimeSeriesRepository` - CRUD for aggregates
  - `AggregationScheduler` - Scheduled job using node-cron
  - Database indexes on (tenant_id, well_id, aggregation_period, timestamp)

- **Presentation Layer:**
  - No direct API endpoint (internal use via queries)

**Patterns Used:**

- [x] Hexagonal Architecture
- [x] Domain-Driven Design
- [x] CQRS Pattern
- [x] Repository Pattern
- [x] Scheduler Pattern

**Testing:**

- [ ] Unit tests for aggregation logic (edge cases: DST, month boundaries)
- [ ] Integration tests with sample data
- [ ] E2E test for scheduled job execution
- [ ] Performance test: aggregate 10K wells < 30 seconds

**Estimation:** 6 hours

### US-1002: Calculate Production Trends (Daily/Weekly/Monthly)

**As a** analytics engine
**I want** to analyze production trends with statistical calculations
**So that** operators can identify anomalies and performance degradation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Trend line calculated using linear regression (recent vs previous period)
- [ ] Anomaly detection using Z-score (values > 2Ïƒ flagged as outliers)
- [ ] Forecast next 7 days using exponential smoothing (ETS)
- [ ] Trend direction (up/flat/down) determined from regression slope
- [ ] Confidence intervals calculated for forecast (95% CI)
- [ ] Handle missing data (gaps in time series) gracefully
- [ ] Recalculate trends incrementally as new data arrives

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Domain Layer:**
  - `ProductionTrend` entity with: direction, slope, r-squared, forecast
  - Value objects: `ForecastPoint`, `ConfidenceInterval`, `AnomalyThreshold`
  - Business logic: `identify anomalies()`, `calculateForecast()`, `getTrendDirection()`

- **Application Layer:**
  - `CalculateTrendCommand` - Compute trends from aggregates
  - `GetTrendQuery` - Retrieve trend for well
  - `GetAnomaliesQuery` - List recent anomalies

- **Infrastructure Layer:**
  - `TrendRepository` - Persist calculated trends
  - Statistical library: `simple-statistics` npm package for linear regression, Z-score, exponential smoothing
  - Cache trends (TTL: 6 hours) to avoid recalculation

- **Presentation Layer:**
  - Query handlers return `TrendDTO` with visualization-ready data

**Patterns Used:**

- [x] Hexagonal Architecture
- [x] Domain-Driven Design
- [x] CQRS Pattern
- [x] Repository Pattern
- [x] Caching Pattern

**Testing:**

- [ ] Unit tests for trend calculations with known datasets
- [ ] Unit tests for anomaly detection (known outliers)
- [ ] Unit tests for forecasting accuracy (test set validation)
- [ ] Integration tests with database
- [ ] E2E test for complete trend pipeline

**Estimation:** 8 hours

### US-1003: Mobile: Trend Mini-Chart on Well Detail Screen

**As a** mobile operator
**I want** to see a small production trend chart (last 30 days) on the well detail screen
**So that** I can quickly assess well health without navigating to a separate analytics view

**Acceptance Criteria:**
