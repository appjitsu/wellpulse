# Rust vs NestJS Performance Analysis for WellPulse

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Context**: API framework decision for WellPulse Oil & Gas Field Data Management Platform
**Decision**: Use NestJS for main API, consider Rust for ML service

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation**: Use **NestJS (TypeScript)** for WellPulse API

**Key Reasons**:
1. WellPulse's expected traffic (0.5 req/sec average, 20 req/sec peak) is **0.08% of NestJS capacity** (25,000 req/sec)
2. Time-to-market is critical for SaaS product validation (NestJS: 8-10 weeks, Rust: 16-20 weeks)
3. Business logic complexity (multi-tenant, multi-database, ETL) favors NestJS ecosystem
4. Hiring: 10x more TypeScript developers available than Rust developers
5. Rust's 20x performance advantage is meaningless at current scale

**Exception**: Consider **Rust for ML service** (CPU-intensive inference workloads)

## When to Choose Each Technology

### ✅ Choose Rust If:

**Performance-Critical Scenarios:**
- **Ultra-high scale**: 100,000+ requests/second per instance
- **Real-time requirements**: Sub-millisecond latency critical (trading systems, gaming, multiplayer)
- **Resource-constrained**: Running on edge devices, IoT, embedded systems
- **Cost optimization at scale**: Serving 1 billion requests/day (fewer servers = lower cost)
- **CPU-intensive**: Heavy computation, ML inference, video processing, image manipulation

**Examples of Companies Using Rust for APIs:**
- **Discord**: Switched read states service from Go to Rust (10 billion messages/day, reduced latency from 100ms to 2ms)
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless runtime (handles 25+ million requests/second globally)
- **AWS Firecracker**: Lambda runtime (microsecond-level VM startup)
- **Figma**: Multiplayer engine (real-time collaboration, sub-10ms latency)
- **Dropbox**: File sync engine (replaced Python, 10x performance improvement)

### ✅ Choose NestJS If:

**Business Logic & Developer Velocity:**
- **Developer velocity matters**: Team knows TypeScript, rapid prototyping needed
- **Business logic complexity**: Hexagonal architecture, DDD patterns, CQRS
- **Ecosystem richness**: Need Passport.js, Bull queues, Nodemailer, Drizzle ORM, Stripe SDK
- **Hiring**: 10x more TypeScript devs than Rust devs (easier to scale team)
- **Moderate scale**: < 10,000 requests/second (NestJS can handle this easily with horizontal scaling)
- **Iterate and pivot fast**: SaaS products need to validate product-market fit quickly

**Examples of Companies Using NestJS:**
- **Tripadvisor**: Microservices architecture (millions of users)
- **Adidas**: E-commerce platform (high traffic)
- **Capgemini**: Enterprise applications (complex business logic)
- **Autodesk**: CAD cloud services (complex domain logic)
- Most B2B SaaS platforms, internal tools, enterprise apps

## WellPulse Traffic Analysis

### Expected Load (Current)

**Assumptions:**
- 100 operators (tenants)
- 50 wells per operator = 5,000 wells total
- 10 field operators entering data daily
- 100 production records/day per operator = 1,000 records/day total
- Web dashboard: 50 active users during business hours

**API Traffic Estimate:**
```
Production entry:   1,000 requests/day = 0.01 req/sec average (peak: 5 req/sec)
Dashboard loads:    50 users × 10 page loads/hour = 0.14 req/sec
Offline sync:       10 devices × 1 sync/hour × 100 events = 0.3 req/sec
ML predictions:     1 prediction/minute = 0.02 req/sec

Total: ~0.5 req/sec average, ~20 req/sec peak
```

**NestJS Capacity**: 25,000 req/sec
**Utilization**: **0.08%** (you're using less than 1% of capacity!)

### Growth Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: 100x Growth (Massive Adoption)
- 10,000 operators × 100 wells = 1 million wells
- 10,000 field operators
- 100,000 production records/day
- **Peak traffic: 500 req/sec**

**NestJS verdict**: **2% capacity utilization**. Still plenty of headroom.

#### Scenario 2: Real-Time SCADA Integration
- Polling 100,000 sensors every 5 seconds
- 20,000 data points/second ingestion
- **Peak traffic: 20,000 req/sec**

**NestJS verdict**: **80% capacity**. Getting tight, but horizontal scaling (5 API instances) solves this easily.

#### Scenario 3: ML Inference at Scale
- 1 million predictions/day
- Heavy CPU computation (decline curve analysis, equipment failure prediction)
- **Sustained high CPU usage**

**Rust verdict**: **This is where Rust shines** - lower latency, lower cost, better CPU efficiency.

## Cost Comparison (at Scale)

### Infrastructure Costs: 10,000 req/sec Sustained

**NestJS (Node.js) Configuration:**
```
CPU: High (single-threaded event loop)
Memory: 120MB per instance
Instances needed: 5 × 2 vCPU instances = 10 vCPUs
Azure cost: 5 × B2s ($48/month each) = $240/month
```

**Rust (Axum) Configuration:**
```
CPU: Low (multi-threaded, zero-cost abstractions)
Memory: 20MB per instance
Instances needed: 2 × 2 vCPU instances = 4 vCPUs
Azure cost: 2 × B2s ($48/month each) = $96/month
```

**Savings**: **$144/month** (60% cheaper) at 10,000 req/sec

**Break-even Analysis:**

| Traffic (req/sec) | NestJS Cost/Month | Rust Cost/Month | Savings/Month | Rewrite Cost (6 months) | ROI Timeline |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 100 | $50 | $20 | $30 | $300,000 | 833 years 🤦 |
| 1,000 | $100 | $40 | $60 | $300,000 | 416 years 🤦 |
| 10,000 | $240 | $96 | $144 | $300,000 | 173 years 🤦 |
| 50,000 | $1,200 | $480 | $720 | $300,000 | 35 years ❌ |
| 100,000 | $2,400 | $960 | $1,440 | $300,000 | 17 years ⚠️ |
| 500,000 | $12,000 | $4,800 | $7,200 | $300,000 | 3.5 years ✅ |

**Key Insight**: Only makes financial sense when compute costs > $5,000/month (500k+ req/sec)

## Recommended Approach for WellPulse

### Phase 1: Start with NestJS (Months 0-12)

**Build entire API in NestJS:**
- ✅ Master database + tenant provisioning
- ✅ Authentication (Passport.js)
- ✅ Wells, production, equipment, ESG modules
- ✅ Multi-database support (Drizzle adapters)
- ✅ ETL sync service
- ✅ Offline sync (event sourcing)

**Why:**
1. **Validate product-market fit** (is WellPulse solving a real problem?)
2. **Ship MVP in 8-10 weeks** (vs 16-20 weeks with Rust)
3. **Iterate based on customer feedback** (pivot fast if needed)
4. **Build customer base** (revenue funds future optimization)

**Current traffic**: 0.5-20 req/sec (0.08% of NestJS capacity)

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approach (Months 12-24, if needed)

**When to consider Rust:**
- Traffic sustained > 5,000 req/sec
- Compute costs > $500/month
- Specific bottlenecks identified (e.g., SCADA ingestion)

**Hybrid Architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   NestJS API (Business Logic)          │
│   - Authentication                       │
│   - Tenant provisioning                 │
│   - CRUD operations                     │
│   - Complex queries                     │
│   - Multi-database adapters             │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │ Calls via HTTP/gRPC
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│   Rust Microservice (Performance)      │
│   - ML inference (Axum + ort)          │
│   - SCADA data ingestion (20k/sec)     │
│   - Real-time analytics                 │
│   - Time-series aggregation             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Effort**: 4-6 weeks to add Rust microservice
**Benefit**: 10x performance on critical paths, keep development velocity on NestJS

### Phase 3: Rust ML Service (Can Start Anytime)

**Replace Python FastAPI with Rust Axum for ML service:**

**Why ML service benefits from Rust:**
- **CPU-intensive**: Inference, decline curve analysis, anomaly detection
- **Low latency**: Equipment failure predictions need < 100ms response
- **Cost-sensitive**: ML inference scales with model complexity
- **Python bottleneck**: NumPy/pandas fast, but orchestration overhead high

**Implementation:**
```
Train models in Python (scikit-learn, PyTorch)
    ↓
Export to ONNX format (.onnx files)
    ↓
Load in Rust (ort - ONNX Runtime)
    ↓
Serve predictions via Axum API
    ↓
10x faster inference, 90% lower memory
```

**Rust ML Stack:**
- **Axum**: Web framework (async, fast)
- **ort**: ONNX Runtime (run PyTorch/TensorFlow models in Rust)
- **burn**: Native Rust ML framework (alternative to ONNX)
- **candle**: PyTorch-like API in Rust
- **polars**: DataFrame library (100x faster than pandas)

**Effort**: 2-4 weeks (if models already trained)
**Benefit**: 10x faster inference, handles 10k predictions/sec on single instance

---

## Migration Path (If Needed in Future)

### Option 1: Selective Rewrite (Recommended)

**Identify hot paths through profiling:**
```bash
# Profile NestJS API under load
npm install --save-dev clinic
clinic doctor -- node dist/main.js

# Identify bottlenecks:
# - SCADA ingestion: 20,000 req/sec
# - Time-series aggregation: CPU-bound
# - ML inference: CPU-bound
```

**Rewrite only hot paths in Rust:**
- Keep 80% in NestJS (authentication, CRUD, business logic)
- Rewrite 20% in Rust (data ingestion, real-time analytics)

**Result**: 80/20 rule - get 80% of Rust's performance benefit with 20% of rewrite effort

### Option 2: Full Rewrite (Last Resort)

**Only do this if:**
1. Compute costs > $5,000/month (indicates massive scale)
2. 6-12 months available for rewrite
3. Dedicated Rust team hired
4. Performance is competitive differentiator (e.g., "fastest oil & gas platform")

**Risks:**
- **Feature freeze**: No new features during rewrite (customers churn)
- **Regression bugs**: Rewriting working software always introduces bugs
- **Opportunity cost**: 6 months not spent on new features/markets

**Mitigation**:
- Strangler fig pattern: Gradually replace NestJS services with Rust
- Run both in parallel: Route 10% traffic to Rust, compare results, scale up
- Feature parity first: Ensure Rust version has all features before switching

## Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Discord - When Rust Made Sense

**Problem**: Read states service (tracking unread messages)
- 10 billion messages/day
- Go version: 100ms latency spikes, frequent garbage collection pauses
- Scaling pain: 200+ servers needed

**Solution**: Rewrote in Rust (Actix-web)
- **Latency**: 100ms → 2ms (50x improvement)
- **Memory**: 70% reduction
- **Servers**: 200 → 40 (5x reduction, $500k/year savings)

**Key Insight**: Only worth it at **10 billion operations/day** scale

**WellPulse comparison**: Currently at 1,000 operations/day (10 million times smaller)

### Case Study 2: Figma - Real-Time Multiplayer

**Problem**: Multiplayer engine for real-time collaboration
- Sub-10ms latency requirement (users notice > 10ms lag)
- JavaScript: 50-100ms latency, unpredictable GC pauses
- WebAssembly: Needed low-latency, deterministic performance

**Solution**: Rust compiled to WebAssembly
- **Latency**: 50ms → 5ms (10x improvement)
- **Predictability**: No GC pauses
- **Users**: Can collaborate on files with 100+ people simultaneously

**Key Insight**: Real-time collaboration demands sub-10ms latency

**WellPulse comparison**: Production data entry can tolerate 100-500ms latency (not real-time)

### Case Study 3: Cloudflare Workers - Serverless at Scale

**Problem**: Serverless edge computing platform
- 25+ million requests/second globally
- Sub-millisecond cold start requirement
- Multi-tenant isolation (security critical)

**Solution**: V8 isolates + Rust runtime
- **Cold start**: < 1ms (vs AWS Lambda: 100-1000ms)
- **Scale**: 25M req/sec on commodity hardware
- **Cost**: 90% cheaper than traditional serverless

**Key Insight**: Rust essential for infrastructure (platforms serving millions)

**WellPulse comparison**: Application-level SaaS, not infrastructure platform

### Case Study 4: Dropbox - File Sync Engine

**Problem**: File sync engine (Python)
- CPU-bound (hashing, compression, deduplication)
- Battery drain on laptops (inefficient Python loops)
- Memory usage (Python objects overhead)

**Solution**: Rewrote sync engine in Rust
- **Performance**: 10x faster syncing
- **Battery**: 50% improvement (less CPU usage)
- **Memory**: 70% reduction

**Key Insight**: CPU-bound workloads benefit most

**WellPulse comparison**: Offline sync in Electron app could benefit (future optimization)

## Conclusion

### For WellPulse API: Use NestJS

**Rationale:**
1. **Current scale** (0.5-20 req/sec) is 0.08% of NestJS capacity
2. **Time-to-market** is more valuable than raw performance
3. **Business logic complexity** (multi-tenant, multi-database) favors mature ecosystem
4. **Team scalability** requires TypeScript (hiring, onboarding)
5. **Cost savings** from Rust don't justify 2x longer development time

### Exception: Rust for ML Service (Optional)

If ML inference becomes bottleneck:
- Replace Python FastAPI with Rust Axum
- Use ONNX Runtime (ort) for model inference
- Train in Python, serve in Rust (best of both worlds)

### The Pragmatic Rule

**"Choose boring technology until boring is the problem."**

- **Boring**: NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis (proven, mature, well-understood)
- **Exciting**: Rust, Deno, Bun (cutting-edge, fewer examples, smaller community)

For a **startup SaaS product**, boring wins. Ship fast, learn from customers, optimize later.

For a **scale-up platform** (Discord, Figma, Cloudflare), exciting wins. Performance is the product.

WellPulse is currently in **startup phase**. Choose boring technology.
