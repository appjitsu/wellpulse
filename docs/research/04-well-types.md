1) Well Types (for small Permian operators)
Production Lift Methods:

Beam Pump (Rod Lift) - Most common for small operators; mechanical pump jacks
Progressive Cavity Pump (PCP) - Increasingly popular; single screw pump driven by electric/gas motor
Submersible Pump - Downhole electric pump; common alternative to rod lift
Gas Lift - Uses compressed gas to reduce fluid density; less common for very small operators but present
Plunger Lift - Specialized for gas wells; uses pressure cycles to unload fluid
Natural Flow/Flowing Wells - Minimal equipment; well produces under its own pressure

Configuration Overlays:

Vertical vs. Horizontal (independent of lift method)
Oil Well vs. Gas Well vs. Multi-phase

For your target market, beam pumps dominate, with PCPs growing. Most small operators won't have gas lift or plunger lift wells.

2) Values Recorded by Well Type
BEAM PUMP WELLS (most important for your market):

Production: Oil (bbls), Water (bbls), Gas (MCF)

Equipment: Pump runtime (hours), Engine hours, Strokes per minute, Stroke length
Conditions: Engine temp, Equipment observations, Maintenance performed
Tank data: Opening gauge, Closing gauge
Observations: Leaks, spills, equipment condition, issues noted

PROGRESSIVE CAVITY PUMP (PCP):

Production: Oil (bbls), Water (bbls), Gas (MCF)
Motor: Amps, Voltage, Temperature, Running hours, RPM

3) Typical Checklists
Most operators use variations of these (larger operators have detailed procedures; smaller ones adapt based on well type):
BEAM PUMP WELL VISIT CHECKLIST:

Key Insight for WellFlow:
Most small operators don't have standardized digital checklists—they either use paper tickets that vary by well or rely on memory. This is a huge gap. If WellFlow:

Has pre-built checklists for each well type
Auto-captures what it can (time, location, well ID)
Makes the checklist context-aware (shows only relevant fields based on well type)
Stores it auditably for RRC compliance

...you'd immediately solve a major pain point for small operators while giving them better data quality than they currently have.
